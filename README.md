# jwl-backup-merger

This Python-based utility simplifies the process of merging backups made by the JW Library app.

## Features

- Combine two or more JW Library backups into one, which can then be re-imported into JW Library on all your devices.
- Automatically detect and merge conflicting data between backups.
- Coming soon: allow for manual conflict resolution.

## Warning and disclaimer
Before attempting to restore merged backups generated by this app, it is **strongly recommended** to create backups using JW Library on **all** your devices and to store these backups safely.

Please note that this project is not affiliated with jw.org or the official JW Library app. It is an independent tool created by me, for personal use. Use this app at your own risk.

## Usage

Pre-requisites:

    pip install tqdm tk python-dateutil requests

Running the app:

    python jwl-backup-merger.py [--debug] [--folder FOLDER_PATH] [--file FILE_PATH] [--file FILE_PATH] ...

### Arguments

- `--folder FOLDER_PATH`: Folder containing JW Library backups to merge.
- `--file FILE_PATH`: JW Library backup to add to the list of backups to merge. You can specify multiple `--file` arguments to merge multiple backups.
- `--debug`: Enable verbose output and keep temporary working files for debugging.
- `--conflict-policy prompt|current|incoming|merged`: Choose interactive or automatic conflict resolution behavior.
- `--verbose-stats`: Print per-table counts for each input DB, merged counts, dedup stats, and dropped-item reasons.

When using `--conflict-policy prompt`, you can optionally configure location-level source preferences at runtime (for highlights, notes, bookmarks, and input fields): choose one or more locations/publications and assign a preferred input backup file to auto-resolve conflicts for those locations.

### Example usage

    python jwl-backup-merger.py --folder /path/to/folder-with-jwl-backups
    python jwl-backup-merger.py --folder /path/to/folder-with-jwl-backups --file /path/to/additional-file1.jwlibrary
    python jwl-backup-merger.py --file /path/to/phone.jwlibrary --file /path/to/tablet.jwlibrary --file /path/to/computer.jwlibrary
